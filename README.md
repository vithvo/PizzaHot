- typeScript;
- React JS v18;
- Redux Toolkit,
- Hooks (useState,useEffect,useRef, useNavigate...);
- React Router v6;

Unfortunately, due to routing issues on GitHab Pages, it was not possible to save filtering settings after page reload. In the code on Githab repository, this moment is implemented using qs.
